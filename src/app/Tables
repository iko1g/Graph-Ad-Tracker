How we plan to implement:
1. We have 3 functions for each CSV file.
2. When the user Selects a CSV file, we need to error check if tables have same number of collumns as expected.
3. If we're reading the file and we throw and exception other than empty file, we need to throw error.
4. Assuming no error, we take the first line and either discard it, or put it as our SQL titles.
5. We go through the file line by line and we convert the values in their correct Java types.
6. Either insert into SQLite one by one, or all at the same time.

7. Erase database before you insert.

8. Improve performance:

a: Use batch inserts
b: Multi-threading/Multiple connectors



Plan for tomorrow:

Clean up the code we have so far.
See how we should input into SQLite.
Create the DB connection.
Parse ito Java files.
